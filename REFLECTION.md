# REFLECTION
Although it's not my first time looking at swift code before this is the first time that I'm developing something even if its simple. The (!) symbol is new for me and became challenging on where to use it effectively. Swift reminds me of the typescript syntax, although I'm new to both to me they have some similarities. Swift Calculator although a simple app, can have a lot of validations of inputs and I learned this is where (!) comes in. Swift is simple to read and if you are used to other programming languages is also easy to make a transition in syntax.
